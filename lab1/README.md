## Getting Started

Please make sure you have access to NCSA delta. Once this is done, you have to install a cuda-compatible version of pytorch (instructions can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)) in a custom conda/pip virtual environment.

for `benchmark_cached/model.py` and `benchmark_uncached/model.py` all the code-snippets that need to be filled out are represented using the _ symbol (and only in the `CausalSelfAttention` class).
